# Magnify-WotLK

Magnify is a World of Warcraft WotLK (3.3.5a) add-on which allows the user to zoom the world map in or out. The functionality was copied from [Magnify](https://github.com/luskanek/Magnify), and updated/reworked to support the WotLK map.

**Features**

- Scroll to zoom on world map
- Ctrl + Scroll to scale the windowed world map
- Recommended: Install [MozzFullWorldMap](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mozz-full-world-map-fans-update/files/430783) addon to display unexplored areas. Combined, these two addons provide similar functionality to Leatrix Maps.

# How to install
 * Click the green Code button near the top right, then select Download ZIP.
 * Extract the contents of the ZIP file to your Interface/AddOns folder.
 * :warning: The extracted folder will have a -main suffix (i.e., Magnify-WotLK-main); **you must rename it to remove the suffix (i.e., Magnify-WotLK).**
 * Restart the game to load the addon.
