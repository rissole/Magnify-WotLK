# Magnify-WotLK

Magnify is a World of Warcraft WotLK (3.3.5a) add-on which allows the user to zoom the world map in or out. The functionality was copied from [Magnify](https://github.com/luskanek/Magnify), and updated/reworked to support the WotLK map.

**Features**

- Scroll to zoom on world map
- Ctrl + Scroll to scale the windowed world map

**Compatibility**

- :white_check_mark: Gatherer
- :white_check_mark: pfQuest
- :exclamation: ElvUI - works, but you must:
  - Disable the Map (/ec -> Maps -> Map tab -> Uncheck 'Enable')
  - Disable the Map skin (/ec -> Skins -> Uncheck 'Map')
